    <h2> Recipe Description </h2>
        <p>
            Is it just me, or does it seem like the kale salad has gone out of style?
            For a while there, the internet was a kale-crazy place to be, but it seems 
            to have fallen out of favor due to Brussels sprouts salads, roasted squash
            salads, and even pasta salads. While I was pondering this important life 
            issue, I realized that it had not only been a while since I’d posted a
            kale recipe – it had been a while since I’d even made a kale salad for
            myself… so I thought – let’s bring it back(!) with this super fresh,
            colorful, rainbow salad recipe.

                <li>1 bunch curly kale, stems removed, leaves torn</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>

                <li> 1 small red beet, grated*</li>
                <li> ½ watermelon radish, very thinly sliced</li>
                <li> 1 avocado, cubed</li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons dried cranberries</li>
                <li> ¼ cup pepitas, toasted</li>

                <li> Sea salt & Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>



    <h2> Instructions </h2>

        <ol>

            <li>Make the dressing and roast the chickpeas: Preheat the
            oven to 400°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment
            paper. Toss the chickpeas with a drizzle of olive oil
            and sprinkle with pinches of salt and pepper. Place
            the carrot pieces for the dressing in their own corner
            on the baking sheet to roast alongside the chickpeas.
            Roast for 25 to minutes, or until the chickpeas are
            browned and crisp and the carrots are soft. Set 
            the roasted chickpeas aside. Transfer the carrots
            to a blender and add the water, olive oil, rice 
            vinegar, ginger, and salt. Blend the dressing until
            smooth and chill in the fridge until ready to use.</li>
                
            <li>Place the kale leaves into a large bowl and drizzle 
            with the lemon juice, ½ teaspoon of olive oil, and 
            a few pinches of salt. Use your hands to massage 
            the leaves until they become soft and wilted and 
            reduce in the bowl by about half.</li>


            <li>Add the carrot, beet, watermelon radish, half of 
            the cubed avocado, cranberries, pepitas, a few more
            good pinches of salt and a few grinds of pepper, 
            and toss. Drizzle generously with the carrot ginger 
            dressing. Top with the remaining avocado, more dressing,
            the roasted chickpeas and sprinkle with the sesame
            seeds. Season to taste and serve.</li>


        </ol>
