    <img src="../imgs/brussel.PNG" alt = "shreeded brussel sprout image">


    <h2> Recipe Description </h2>
    <p>
        It’s a breeze to put together. Simply shave your sprouts (or use pre-shredded Brussels sprouts), 
        and toss them with olive oil, lemon, dried cranberries, grated cheese, pine nuts, chives, salt & pepper.

        You can prep it hours in advance. The hearty Brussels sprouts hold up well even if you dress them ahead of time,
        so this recipe is a perfect one to make ahead for holiday parties.

        Even though it’s made with so FEW ingredients, it’s so delicious. The bright lemon, chewy, tart cranberries, 
        and salty cheese are a simple, yet addictive combination. With just a few ingredients, this salad checks all the 
        flavor boxes.
