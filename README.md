First project running through the Odin Project. Just reviewing and running through the HTML basics (11.22.22)

The scope of these projects is to bridge the gaps bewteen my backend knowledge, CS degree, and VFX work from the last 2 years.
Specically building a bridge from the JS + three.js side (web dev) and VFX (C4D // Houdini // AE // Octane -> probably transitioning to red shift bec maxon only cares about RS lol)
